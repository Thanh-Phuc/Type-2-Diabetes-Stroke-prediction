# Introduction

This study aimed to use machine learning algorithms to predict stroke risk in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and develop a web application for estimating five-year stroke incidence, thus aiding in identifying high-risk patients

# Description
We developed an advanced web application for predicting the five-year risk of stroke. Leveraging an XGBoost model for accurate predictions and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for model interpretability, the application is built using Streamlit, a Python library specifically designed for creating interactive web applications.

- Framework: Built using Streamlit, which simplifies the development of interactive data applications in Python.
- Interface: Provides an intuitive interface that allows users to easily input their data and obtain predictions regarding their stroke risk.
- Dynamic Visualizations: The application utilizes Streamviz to create dynamic visualizations, including SHAP plots such as waterfall. These visualizations effectively illustrate how each feature contributes to the prediction of stroke risk.
